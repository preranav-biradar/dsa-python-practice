# 🐍 Python DSA & Logic Building Practice

Welcome to my Python practice repository! This repo contains solutions to essential programming problems and DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) concepts written in Python. It’s a reflection of my continuous learning journey and problem-solving skills in core programming and Python.


## File Structure

├── arrays.py # Array-based problems (Two sum, Max/Min, etc.)
├── palindrome_check.py # Palindrome logic using strings
├── practise.py # General problems (tables, prime numbers, loops)
├── recursion.py # Recursive functions (like factorial, Fibonacci)
├── searching.py # Linear & Binary Search

## 🧠 What's Inside

### ✅ Arrays (`arrays.py`)
- Two Sum Problem
- Reverse array
- Max and Min in array

### 🔁 Recursion (`recursion.py`)
- Factorial using recursion
- Fibonacci series
- Sum of digits

### 🔍 Searching (`searching.py`)
- Linear Search
- Binary Search (Iterative and Recursive)

### 📊 Sorting (`sorting.py`)
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort

### 🔤 Strings (`string.py`, `palindrome_check.py`)
- Palindrome check
- String reverse
- Count vowels, consonants

### 🔁 Practice Logic (`practise.py`)
- Multiplication table
- Prime numbers between 1–50
- Largest of 3 numbers using nested if
- Numbers divisible by 3 and 5
- First N natural numbers using while loop
- Break statement example


## 💡 Why This Repository?

I created this repo to:
- Strengthen core logic-building with Python.
- Practice frequently asked coding interview problems.
- Prepare for placement rounds.
- Document my learning in clean and organized code files.


## 🚀 Next Goals
- Add DSA problems by topics (Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists).
- Create folders for each concept for clarity.
- Add complexity analysis in comments.
